      <p>
        These Terms, together with the

      <h3 id="severability">13.2 Severability</h3>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or
        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
        modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or
        if modification is not possible, shall be severed from these Terms. The
        remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

      <h3 id="waiver">13.3 Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        The failure of ClaudeNest to enforce any right or provision of these Terms

        ClaudeNest.
